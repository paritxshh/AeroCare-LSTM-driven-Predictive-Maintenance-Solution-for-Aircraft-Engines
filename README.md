## Overview

AeroCare is a predictive maintenance solution designed specifically for monitoring and maintaining aircraft engines using LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural networks. This project aims to enhance the safety, reliability, and efficiency of aircraft operations by predicting engine failures before they occur, thereby reducing downtime and maintenance costs.

## Key Features

- LSTM-based predictive modeling for engine health monitoring
- Real-time data ingestion and processing
- Anomaly detection and early fault prediction
- Web dashboard for visualization and analysis
- Scalable architecture for handling large volumes of data
- Integration with existing aircraft maintenance systems
